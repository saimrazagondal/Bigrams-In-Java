# Bigrams-In-Java
A small Java project to display bigrams of a certain input of text, their occurrence frequency and their proportional frequency relative to the total bigrams!

This contains only one main method and Map structures are used for the said purpose!
Feel free to contact me if there is any ambiguity!
